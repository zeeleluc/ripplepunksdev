                You may notice a different total on Café—that’s because we’re currently minting 10,000 additional RipplePunks. The CTO community is planning to stall their RipplePunks in a wallet they can’t access or control. They’re doing this because I’m not handing over the royalties wallet, which I’ve built and maintained with my own effort. Instead of abandoning the original, I’m preserving it—and pushing it forward—with The Other RipplePunks: a new wave of 10,000 original combinations, listed at just 2 XRP each, no matter the type or rarity. Fair and open to all.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                There are no promises, no points systems, and no complex utilities or royalty shares—at least not for now. This is about preserving history, and making new history, on XRPL. Check the blockchain and volume. We’re here for the long game—minting may take months.

                It’s easy to throw around accusations and call the developer a scammer—but let’s stick to the facts. The developer was the only one consistently building on top of the project, shipping features that the broader community often ignored. While many were focused solely on accessing a portion of the royalties, the dev kept building.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                50% of royalties were voluntarily shared with the community until it became legally impossible to continue doing so—coinciding with a period when sales had already slowed to nearly zero. Even after that, the developer continued to support the project by sweeping the floor using what little royalties were received. These RipplePunks were handed to a CTO member with the promise they’d be used in giveaways—a promise that was never fulfilled, though that part tends to get left out.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Yes, the dev once told a community member to “fuck off”—a mistake that was quickly followed by an apology and a brief explanation of a personal struggle at the time, though that’s never mentioned.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Also forgotten: the developer swept floors of many other XRPL projects and gave away those NFTs as well. Over 75% of minting profits were redistributed in giveaways—literally putting money back into the community’s hands.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Anyway… it wasn’t enough. The message was clear: “Hand over the royalties or get lost.”
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                So, I left.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                But when I saw they planned to burn or lock up the original RipplePunks in an abandoned wallet, I stepped back in—because I’m not letting my hard work be erased by a bunch of freeloaders acting like divas, only showing up when it’s time to collect.
