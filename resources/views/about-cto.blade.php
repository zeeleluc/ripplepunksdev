                There was once a much longer message here — one that tried to explain, clarify, and push back against false accusations. But that kind of energy doesn’t belong on this site, and it certainly doesn’t belong in the future of RipplePunks.

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <strong class="text-primary">The Dev</strong> genuinely wishes the CTO team all the best with their forked version of RipplePunks. May their journey be smooth and their project find its audience.

                As for this version of RipplePunks — the real version — the focus remains on building, preserving, and evolving the legacy in a way that stays true to its roots.
